3.0 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The CLSE comprises five major subsystems:

⸻

3.1 Atmospheric Regeneration Subsystem (ARS)

Purpose:

Maintain breathable gas composition and regulate humidity.

Components:
	•	Green-wall oxygenation panels (12 vertical arrays)
	•	Algae photobioreactors (6 fluidic tubes, spiral configuration)
	•	CO₂ scrubbers (solid-oxide, regolith-supported ceramic membranes)
	•	Humidity condensers
	•	VOC-removal microbe chambers

Outputs:
	•	O₂ generation: 0.9 kg/day per crew member
	•	CO₂ capture: 1.0 kg/day per crew member
	•	Target humidity: 35–45%

⸻

3.2 Water Recovery & Purification Subsystem (WRPS)

Purpose:

Ensure continuous, potable water supply.

Components:
	•	Greywater bioremediation beds (mycelium + activated carbon matrix)
	•	Reverse-osmosis polishing unit
	•	Atmospheric condensate harvesters
	•	Thermal distillation loop
	•	Subsurface ice extractor interface (optional, for Mars-sourced water)

Efficiency:
	•	Recycling: 96–98%
	•	Production capacity: 220–280 liters/day

⸻

3.3 Regenerative Agriculture Subsystem (RAS)

Purpose:

Provide plant-based food, nutrient balancing, and psychological benefits.

Growing Platforms:
