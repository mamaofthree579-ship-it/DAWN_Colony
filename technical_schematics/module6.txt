MODULE 6 — GEOTHERMAL ENERGY & PLANETARY HEAT EXCHANGE ARRAY (GPEA-06)

Revision: A
Classification: Civil / Energy Infrastructure
Function: Primary thermal regulation + supplemental power generation
Applicable Systems: MHS-01 through APW-02 integration

1.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The Geothermal Energy & Planetary Heat Exchange Array (GPEA-06) provides:
	•	Deep-bore thermal energy extraction (3.2–11.4 kW continuous per bore).
	•	Habitat temperature buffering and cooling/heating load reduction.
	•	Planetary thermal stability around the settlement (micro-climate modulation).
	•	Emergency backup heat source independent of solar conditions.
	•	Heat-sink interface for industrial units (metal printing, regolith sintering).

This module is a distributed, radial, shallow–to–mid-depth thermal system, optimized for Mars’ crustal composition and low atmospheric convective efficiency.

4.0 SYSTEM OPERATION

4.1 Primary Heat Mode (Extraction)

Heat drawn from deep subsurface → circulated via PCM-enhanced coolant → transferred into:
	•	Habitat hydronic loops
	•	Air handling units
	•	Agricultural grow tower thermal stabilizers

Average extraction: 3.2 kW per bore
Max combined output (8 bores): 25–26 kW continuous

4.2 Reverse Mode (Heat Dumping)

Industrial processes generate excess heat → coolant loops transfer → deep crust sinks dissipate energy.

Dump capacity: 40–72 kW peak
Necessary for smelters, 3D metal sintering, and life-support heat spikes.
