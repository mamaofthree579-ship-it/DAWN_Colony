Module 2 — Atmospheric Processing & Water Extraction Hub (APW-02)

Revision: A
Authoring System: DAWN Engineering Core
Format: Blueprint-spec textual engineering sheet
Purpose: Harvesting, refining, storing, and distributing water and atmospheric gases on Mars

1.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The Atmospheric Processing & Water Extraction Hub (APW-02) serves as the colony’s:
	•	Primary water acquisition and purification module
	•	Atmospheric conversion and storage plant
	•	Source of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon for the habitat
	•	Feedstock provider for fuel production and agricultural humidity stabilization
	•	Redundancy node for environmental autonomy if the Main Habitat Superstructure (MHS-01) experiences isolation

This module runs autonomously with intelligent feedback loops, capable of sustaining up to 72 personnel across the Dawn Colony network.
