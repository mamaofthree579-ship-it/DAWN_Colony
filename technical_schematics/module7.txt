1.0 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

The Planetary Communication Spine (PCS) is a redundant, hybrid communication infrastructure providing:
	•	Local, colony-wide real-time mesh communication
	•	Long-range surface-to-orbit and orbit-to-Earth data relay
	•	Quantum-stabilized timing synchronization between modules
	•	Dust storm–resilient optical communication pathways
	•	Emergency mode low-power fallback channels
	•	Integration with orbital relay constellation nodes

The system is built to maintain continuous link reliability ≥ 99.995% even during Mars’ worst environmental events.
