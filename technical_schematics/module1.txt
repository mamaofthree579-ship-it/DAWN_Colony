DAWN COLONY — TECHNICAL SCHEMATICS (WRITTEN BLUEPRINT SET)

Module 1 — MAIN HABITAT SUPERSTRUCTURE (MHS-01)

Revision: A
Authoring System: DAWN Engineering Core
Format: Blueprint-spec textual engineering sheet
Purpose: Human habitation, base operations, environmental stability, pressurized living quarters

1.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The Main Habitat Superstructure (MHS-01) serves as:
	•	Primary living environment for initial settlers (12–48 personnel scale).
	•	Core pressure-stabilized volume for life support.
	•	Structural anchor for subsequent modules and expansion nodes.
	•	Thermal, radiation, and atmospheric shielding hub.
	•	Integration point for agricultural, energy, and command submodules.

The structure is designed for in-situ fabrication using regolith-derived composites, fungal-mycelial binder matrices, and lightweight Earth-shipped prefabricated joints.

2.3 Stress Distribution Notes
	•	Hexagon radial symmetry yields even stress dissipation under Mars wind and thermal cycling.
	•	Dome curvature selected to minimize shearing at morning–night thermal gradients.
	•	Internal ribs support both vertical (1/3g) and lateral loads.
