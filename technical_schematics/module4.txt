Module 4 — SUBTERRANEAN AGRICULTURAL BIOSYSTEMS COMPLEX (SAB-04)

Revision: A
Purpose: High-yield food production, oxygen generation, bio-material production, biome stability
Placement: Fully or partially subterranean to maximize thermal stability and radiation shielding

4.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The Subterranean Agricultural Biosystems Complex (SAB-04) is the primary biological production and carbon cycling heart of the Dawn Colony. It anchors:
	•	Food production (fungal, hydroponic, aeroponic, soil-based experimental plots)
	•	O₂ production and CO₂ uptake
	•	Mycelial fabrication substrate (for construction + bioplastics)
	•	Ecological psychological support (bioluminescent groves, sensory gardens)
	•	Genetic seed vault and micro-ecological diversity chambers

This module is designed for fully redundant, multi-species, multi-layer agriculture optimized for Mars gravity, low atmospheric pressure, limited water, and internal nutrient cycling.
